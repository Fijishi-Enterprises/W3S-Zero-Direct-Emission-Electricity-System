# Server for optimising Wind-Hydrogen-Other-Battery-Solar (WHOBS) systems


## Requirements

Redis, Flask

ninja files


## Run without server

See the regular [WHOBS](https://github.com/PyPSA/WHOBS) repository.

## Run server locally on your own computer

To run locally you need to start the Python Flask server in one terminal, and redis in another:

Start the Flask server in one terminal with:

`python flask_queue.py`

This will serve to local address:

http://127.0.0.1:5002/

In the second terminal start Redis:

`rq worker whobs`

where `whobs` is the name of the queue. No jobs will be solved until
this is run. You can run multiple workers to process jobs in parallel.


## Deploy on a server

gunicorn, etc.
